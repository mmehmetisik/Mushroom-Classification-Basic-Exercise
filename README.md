# Mushroom-Classification---Basic-Exercise

- In this project, we will use a public dataset from kaggle.com, the “Mushroom Classification” dataset, and try to figure out if a mushroom is edible or not.
- This dataset includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms. Each species is identified as edible or poisonous.
- When it comes to mushrooms, there is no simple rule for determining the edibility.
